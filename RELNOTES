r350665:
	The fuse driver has been renamed to fusefs(5) and been substantially
	rewritten.  The new driver includes many bug fixes and performance
	enhancements, as well as the following user-visible features:
	* Optional kernel-side permissions checks (-o default_permissions)
	* mknod(2), socket(2), and pipe(2) support
	* server side locking with fcntl(2)
	* FUSE operations are now interruptible when mounted with -o intr
	* server side handling of UTIME_NOW during utimensat(2)
	* mount options may be updated with "mount -u"
	* fusefs file system may now be exported over NFS
	* RLIMIT_FSIZE support
	* support for fuse file systems using protocols as old as 7.4
	
	FUSE file system developers should also take note of the following new
	features:
	* The protocol level has been raised from 7.8 to 7.23
	* kqueue support on /dev/fuse
	* server-initiated cache invalidation via FUSE_NOTIFY_REPLY

r350471:
	gnop(8) can now configure a delay to be applied to read and write
	request delays.  See the -d, -q and -x parameters.

r350315, r350316:
	Adds a Linux compatible copy_file_range(2) syscall.

r350307:
	libcap_random(3) has been removed.  Applications can use native
	APIs to get random data in capability mode.

	nand(4) and related components have been removed.

r349349:
	The UEFI loader now supports HTTP boot.

	guests to play to and record audio data from the host.

r349286:
	swapon(8) can now erase a swap device immediately before enabling it,
	similar to newfs(8)'s -E option.  This behaviour can be specified by
	adding -E to swapon(8)'s command-line parameters, or by adding the
	"trimonce" option to a swap device's /etc/fstab entry.

	The following network drivers have been removed: bm(4), cs(4), de(4),
